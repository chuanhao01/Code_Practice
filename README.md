# Learn Competitive Programming

This is the repo where I will be uploading my solutions as I try and learn about competitive programming.  
I use quite a lot of different sites for this, namely:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Code Signal](https://codesignal.com/)
- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)

I picked up competitive programming as a way to learn more about being a better programmer.  
This was as I had no experience in basic data structures and algorithms and my school at the time did not really teach any of these things.  
Thus I decided to learn competitive programming both because I had an intrest in it for quite some time, but also because I wanted the knowledge of data structures and algorithms to become a better software engineer.  

I am by no means a very serious competitive programmer and just doing this mainly as an interest.  

I am also using this README and repo as some sort of journal to pen down some things that have happened.
